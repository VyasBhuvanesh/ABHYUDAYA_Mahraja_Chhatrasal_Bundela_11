<p><b>Hostel Complaint &
Maintenance Tracking System made by team Tech_Titans</b></p>
<p> Our Problem statement: Build a web-based system to manage hostel-related complaints and maintenance requests in a
structured and transparent way. Students should be able to raise complaints (e.g., plumbing,
electricity, cleanliness, internet, room issues), track their status, and provide feedback after
resolution. Wardens/maintenance teams should be able to view and manage all complaints,
prioritize them, assign tasks to staff, and monitor pending or overdue issues. The platform must
support a clear workflow for complaint handling (e.g., Submitted ? Assigned ? In Progress ?
Resolved/Closed), enable priority-based handling (Low/Medium/High), and provide basic
analytics to help hostel administration identify recurring issues, resolution time patterns, and
backlog/overdue trends.</p>
<p> Our proposed solution: We provide a web based solution to the proposed real issue faced by many students where we provide platform where students residing in hostel. Where the
students can send complaints other suggestion requests can be given which will be divided by a level of priority according to which the warden or
authorities resolves regarding issues where the students track the progress of issue resolution.</p>
